# Data_Visualizations
Data visualization is a general term that describes any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. 

This repository recorded all my interesting data Visualizations and Explorations 

# Frequency Histogram Plot for Over 10k cloumns

Using Python package Seaborn

This data has been pre-cleaned by grouping the date and the EquimentID to calculate the frequency of Equiments

# SurveyData Exploration using Heatmap and Distribution Plot

Using Python package Seaborn

This is the survey data include over 100 users sensory test on a Chicken fry

For each feature (question) in the survey, the tester will need to give a score from 0 - 10

Calculate Corelation rate between two festures and find interesting colrelations
